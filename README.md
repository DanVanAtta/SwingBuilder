# SwingBuilder
Simplified and type-safe builder API for javax.swing components

# Importing with Gradle*

*(not yet live on MavenCentral)
```
compile 'com.github.DanVanAtta:swingbuilders:0.0.17'
```

# Building project with IDE (IDEA)

Run:
```bash
./gradlew idea
```

Then open IDEA: 
- select import project from existing sources 
- select project gradle file
- use "file based" instead of "folder based"; would avoid the overwrite "idea" folder warning



# Examples

***coming soon***


# Releases

A new version is pushed to bintray (jcenter) after each commit to master.
