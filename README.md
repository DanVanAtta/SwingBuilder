# SwingBuilder
Simplified and type-safe builder API for javax.swing components

# Importing with Gradle

```
compile 'org.better.swing.builders:SwingBuilders:0.0.17'
```

# Building project with IDE (IDEA)

Run:
```bash
./gradlew idea
```

Then open IDEA: 
- select import project from existing sources 
- select project gradle file
- use "file based" instead of "folder based"; would avoid the overwrite "idea" folder warning



# Examples
